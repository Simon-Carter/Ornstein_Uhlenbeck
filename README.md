## Data

### CSV format

Each csv file is formatted in columns with labels as the first row. If there is a number at the end of the label, then that corresponds to multiple different simulations measuring the same value, with each number labeling the specifics simulation.

### Files

#### Mixed_course.csv
##### Data generated by [mixed_coarse_gen.jl](mixed_coarse_gen.jl)

20 different simulations where run each containing 1500 points of data. The mixed Gaussian model was used with a ratio of 1 and a thermal noise of 0.2. The varying parameter was the ratio of sample rate to time constant, $\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}$, using 0:0.1:2. The posterior was sampled using markov chain monte carlo using a NUTS sampler at 0.65 for 1000 iterations.

#### Mixed_fine.csv
##### Data generated by [mixed_fine_gen.jl](mixed_fine_gen.jl)

A single simulation was run where each containing 1500 points of data. The mixed Gaussian model was used with a ratio of 1 and a thermal noise of 0.2. The varying parameter was the ratio of sample rate to time constant, $\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}$, using 0:0.005:1. The posterior was sampled using markov chain monte carlo using a NUTS sampler at 0.65 for 1000 iterations.

#### Mixed_many.csv
##### Data generated by [mixed_many_gen.jl](mixed_many_gen.jl)

20 simulations were run where each containing 1500 points of data. The Mixed Gaussian model was used with a ratio of 1 and a thermal noise of 0.2. The varying parameter was the ratio of sample rate to time constant, $\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}$, using 0.05:0.05:1. The posterior was sampled using markov chain monte carlo using a NUTS sampler at 0.65 for 1000 iterations.

#### Thermal.csv
##### Data generated by [thermal_gen.jl](thermal_gen.jl)
A single simulation was run where each containing 1500 points of data. The Thermal model was used with a ratio of 1 and a thermal noise of 0.2. The varying parameter was the ratio of sample rate to time constant, $\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}$, using 0:0.005:1. The posterior was sampled using markov chain monte carlo using a NUTS sampler at 0.65 for 1000 iterations.

#### Mixed_ratio.csv
##### Data generated by [mixed_ratio_gen.jl](mixed_ratio_gen.jl)
A single simulation was run where each containing 1500 points of data. The Mixed model was used with a $\frac{\Delta t}{\tau} = 0.5$. The ratio of mixed to thermal noise was varied by 0.1:0.1:10. The thermal noise was calculated such that the summation of the thermal and multiplicative noise amounted to 0.2. The posterior was sampled using markov chain monte carlo using a NUTS sampler at 0.65 for 1000 iterations.
